These are the standards we want to stick to for development.

Number of spaces = 4

Pull Requests:
- Never Commit directly to Master
- Don't merge your own pull requests
- Ping the slack whenever you put out a pull request

Approving Pull Requests:
- Merge other's pull requests early and often
- Comments on small nitpick stuff are usually not important
- Keep comments constructive
- Make sure you read the code, that it compiles, and that you have actually tested the app with the new code before you approve it

Tests:
- Please write tests for your code
- Pull requests should contain tests for code that they add
- 75% test coverage should be the minimum goal
- Manually test the app in addition to written tests, particularly to ensure the UI is not wonky
